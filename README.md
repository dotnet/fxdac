# fxdac is a tool for expanding our contracts while preserving compatibility with existing contracts and with specific existing platfroms

We could create the contracts manually, but it could be not very reliable and not re-entrant. The tool generates contracts programatically, and so can be fixed if we discover reliability issues.
