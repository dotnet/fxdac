# What is fxdac?

fxdac is a tool for expanding our contracts while preserving compatibility with
existing contracts and with specific existing platforms.

We could create the contracts manually, but it could be not very reliable and
not re-entrant. The tool generates contracts programmatically, and so can be
fixed if we discover reliability issues.
