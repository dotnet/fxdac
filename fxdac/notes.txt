The following types (in Threading.Security) should be in System.Threading. But they have a dependency on AccessControl

System.Threading.EventWaitHandle
System.Threading.AutoResetEvent
System.Threading.ManualResetEvent
System.Threading.AbandonedMutexException
System.Threading.Mutex

ArgIterator cannot be added as TypedReference cannot be returned
